# Timeouts and Fault Injection

Note: All yamls are configured with shoppingportal namespace, So make sure you have shoppingportal namespace

### Timeout

In this example we will show how you can demonstrate how can you add resiliency via timeouts in your application. First, we want to create a 1-second timeout to the vote service, so the product review service can stop listening if it is not responding within 1-second.

````
kubectl create -f timeout-virtualservice.yaml
````

We have added one endpoint which sleeps for 5 secs. 

````
curl http://192.168.99.100:32596/productreviewms/productreview/timeout/2
````

### Fault Injection

A route rule can specify one or more faults to inject while forwarding HTTP requests to the ruleâ€™s corresponding request destination. The faults can be either delays or aborts.

The following example introduces a 2 second delay in 100% of the requests product review microservice

````
kubectl create -f  fault-injection-virtualservice.yaml
````
